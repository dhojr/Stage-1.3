    <div class="overview">
      <p>This is Garry Monk's year. After signing <b>no-one</b> of note, selling Lewis Cook, losing several on the trot and being cited by the FA, he still has The Whites lurking mid-table.

      <p>So if the first months sum up what to expect for this season, what does the future hold?</p>
    </div>
    <div class="profiles">
      <h2>The Future</h2>
      <p><b>The kids have all been sold</b>, so it falls to a group of recent signings to hold together as the side's core for the next couple of seasons. There has been much hype surrounding Alex Mowatt, Dominic Poleon and others but they haven't shown real star quality thus far. Rather, it has been players like Chris Wood who have mad an impact when it matters this season
      </p>
      <p><b>Commercial stability</b> will be key to Monk's plans to grow the club. With the minority ownership structure still uncertain and Cellini looking to exit it will be difficult to settle a squad capable of challenging for the playoffs without some resolution in the front office. Even if this is resolved it will take time for a long-term core to gel; in the meantime the best that can be hoped for is that the current group of journeymen hit form at the right time and fluke themselves into the playoffs.

    <h3>Who might be at the core in 2019/20?</h3>
    <div class="starlets">
      <h2>Alex Mowatt</h2>
        <p>So we panned him a little....he's still a classy player and will mature into a solid player if we can keep him.

      <h2>Kalvin Philips</h2>
        <p>Lots of promise, and signed a new 3-year deal earlier in the year. Won't make or break the squad anytime soon, but could be a first-team regular.
        </p>

      <h2>Ronaldo Vieira</h2>
        <p>Could he develop into a replacement for Lewis Cook? He has lots of learning to do, but the potential is evident and he has the star quality to win over fans quickly.
